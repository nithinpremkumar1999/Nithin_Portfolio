      <description>Final Year Undergraduate Project, worked individually to find an appropriate traditional Statistical Model to predict future VIX values. The data set contains information from 1990, February 01 to 2021, December 13. Followed the Box-Jenkins method to find the appropriate p, d, and q values for ARIMA model. Points to improve: Model was not able to predict the sudden fluctuations due to external factors. Could have implemented a Deep Learning Model in addition to achieve a better result.</description>

      <description>Final Year Undergraduate Project, worked in a team of four and coordinated the team in the project. Created a bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Model to classify into top five genres: thrillers, Crime Fiction, Romance, Action, and Short films. The data used for the project was from the CMU Movie Summary Corpus (http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ark/personas/) collected by David Bamman, Brendan O&amp;rsquo;Connor, and Noah Smith at the Language Technologies Institute and Machine Learning Department at Carnegie Mellon University.</description>

      <description>Hi! My name is Nithin Premkumar; I am an aspiring Data Scientist with a deep interest in applying Statistics and Deep Learning in Finance. I graduated from the University of Toronto with an Honors Bachelor of Science Specializing in Statistics and a Double Minor in Mathematics &amp;amp; Computer Science in June 2022. I am looking for Data Analyst/Data Scientist roles, preferably in Banks and Software companies. I have a few of my projects on this site.</description>
